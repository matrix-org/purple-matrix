 *
 *
 * There is one PurpleAccount for each account the user has configured.
 *
 * Each PurpleAccount has at most one active connections. When the user enables
 * the account, a PurpleConnection is made, and we attach a MatrixConnectionData
 * to it - this is managed in matrix-connection.c. If there is an error on the
 * connection, or the user explicitly disables the account, the PurpleConnection
 * is deleted, and the MatrixConnectionData along with it.
 *
 * A PurpleChat (and a PurpleBuddy, but we don't have much to do with them)
 * represents an entry on the buddylist. It has a hashtable called 'components'
 * which stores the necessary information about the chat - in our case this is
 * just the room id.
 *
 * A PurpleConversation represents an active conversation, and has a chat window
 * associated with it. Its 'name' is not visible to the user; instead it is
 * a unique id for the conversation - in our case the room id. Libpurple has
 * some magic which looks up the 'name' against the 'components' of PurpleChats
 * in the buddy list, and if a match is found, will set the title automatically.
 *
 * The PurpleConversation also has a hashtable which is used to track a range of
 * protocol-specific data: see PURPLE_CONV_DATA_* in matrix-room.c for details
 * of this.
